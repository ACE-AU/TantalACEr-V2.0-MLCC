# TantalACEr-V2.0-MLCC
TantalACEr V2.0 MLCC revision
# PS3-TantalACEr-PCB
Custom PCB for replacing PS3 NEC-Tokin Capacitors in all PS3 motherboard revisions that house the NEC-Tokin Capacitors. 
These PCB's replace 2 x NEC's with 1 PCB.
Populate each PCB with 
6 x 470uf 2.5v 7343-20 low ESR Tantalum Capacitors
2 x 47uf 0805 10v
2 x 22uf 0805 10v
2 x 10uf 0805 10v
2 x 4.7uf 0805 10v
2 x 2.2uf 0805 10v
2 x 1uf 0805 10v
....0.8mm is recommended PCB thickness.

You could also try SONY's MLCC population on the RSX and CELL with 12 x 22uf 0805 10v ceramic capacitors.
I have not personally tested this and take no responsibility
